#+Title: Mnemoboid

** In a nutshell

Look at an org-mode outline as a 3D sky-cube from the inside. Mnemoboid builds a
bridge between an org-mode outline in Emacs and its 3D representation by the way
of Three.js  in modern browsers. A  cube naturally comprises six  sides and each
headline is  displayed on one  of the sides. With  more than six  headlines, the
sides  are  divided  into  tiles  of  size 1x1,  2x2,  or  3x3.  Each  headline,
subheadline, paragraph  and list item  of the outline  can be complemented  by a
drawer which holds additional information, i.e., the mnemonic device.

Have your memory palace displayed in front of your eyes!

** What is a Mnemoboid?

Mnemoboid is a  contraction of the words Mnemonic and  Cuboid. A mnemonic device
aids information  retention. It  helps to  remember. A cuboid  is a  3D-cube. It
helps  to visualise  information  by  realising the  concept  of a  standardised
hierarchical memory palace.

** Installation

*** Doom Emacs

- Clone files into =~/.doom.d= with

=git clone https://github.com/RetepRennelk/mnemoboid.git ~/.doom.d=

- Configure Emacs by adding the following to =config.el=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package! mnemoboid
  :load-path "~/.doom.d/mnemoboid")
#+END_SRC

+ Finally update Doom Emacs with =doom sync=

** Basic Usage

Create an  org-mode file  and from within  its buffer  call =mnemoboid-browser=.
This will  open the  system's default  browser to a  website hosted  from within
Emacs.
